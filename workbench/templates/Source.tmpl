%This facility acts as a source of material with a fixed throughput 
%(per
%time step) capacity and a lifetime capacity defined 
%by a total inventory
%size.  It offers its material as a single 
%commodity. If a composition
%recipe is specified, it provides 
%that single material composition to
%requesters.  If unspecified, 
%the source provides materials with the exact
%requested 
%compositions.  The inventory size and throughput both 
%default to
%infinite.  Supplies material results in corresponding 
%decrease in
%inventory, and when the inventory size reaches 
%zero, the source can provide
%no more material.
